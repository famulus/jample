# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# This file helps you audit or opt OUT of specific Rails 8.1 defaults if needed.
# Since config.load_defaults 8.1 is set, you already run with the 8.1 defaults.
# Leave settings commented unless you intentionally want to diverge.

# Example: keep older cookie serializer (NOT recommended)
# Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :json

# Example: use legacy SQL comment tag format instead of SQLCommenter
# Rails.application.config.active_record.query_log_tags_format = :legacy

# Example: stick to old message serializer (NOT recommended)
# Rails.application.config.active_support.message_serializer = :json_allow_marshal
